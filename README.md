### Ground states of the Hamiltonian

Last time, we talked about how we calculate the total energy of a wavefunction. This time, we're going to look at what the ground states look like.

As you'll recall, there's a

LOTS OF EXAMPLES

perturbation theory?
variational method?


### Stationary states


### Identical particles

### Where to go from here

- Things you can analyse only with what we've talked about so far:
  - chemistry
  - states of matter
  - solids

## Notes

Things that I'd like to explain at some point:

- chemistry
  - in particular, the Hydrogen atom
  - "Computational chemistry is a sequence of approximations to the stuff we've talked about here"
- van der Waals forces
- Relativity
  - We can get *some* of the way by adding another term to the Hamiltonian
- linear and nonlinear variational methods
- sizes of the rows of the periodic table

Things to remember to name

- The Born-Oppenheimer approximation

Other points I haven't made:

- Classical mechanics was missing non-1/r force laws.
- Classical mechanics can't explain stuff.
- The different worlds of protons and electrons. The protons in the upper world are moving according to a conservative force. The electrons are just doing their thing
  - How does this actually play out? what's the breakdown between proton KE, electron wavefunction KE and PE?
- QM is first order.



## Things I don't understand

- What kind of thing is spin
  - I should probably relearn quantum computation

## Things to mention at the end

- DFT
- Periodic solids
- Relativistic corrections
- Where to go from here: QFT
