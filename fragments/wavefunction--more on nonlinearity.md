MAYBE ANALOGY: Similarly, imagine you have a bunch of non-coupled springs in a row:

They're all doing their things separately, and you can model them just fine as separate systems.

But if they're attached to each other:

Suddenly you have to care about the state of the neighbouring springs.


ALTERNATIVELY, different analogy: a pool is kind of like a probability distribution over water particles. You can view the height of different parts of the water as a pdf. But if you want to know how it evolves over time, you can't just evolve the water level at each point independently--the water level evolves in a way that is intimately affected by how the water level varies right near it. The mechanics of wavefunctions is very similar.

Another part of this point: Quantum mechanics makes more sense if you think of a particle moving along as a wave in the amplitudes of consecutive configurations, as opposed to one configuration evolving into another. This is similar to how water waves travel horizontally while the individual particles stay mostly in place.

In math language, we'd say that the time evolution of a wavefunction isn't linear.
