Quantum mechanics was the first physical theory of stuff.

It’s still pretty accurate.

If you want to know the physics behind the behavior of the matter around you, you end up mostly studying the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons. Why electrons? Well, stuff is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons, but the first two mostly stay stuck together in nuclei. So as far as humans are concerned, nuclei are indivisible black boxes.

So chemistry has these fundamental ideas of nuclei and electrons. Why do we mostly end up caring about the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons rather than nuclei? The answer to this question is surprisingly subtle and (CITATION NEEDED) physics majors normally don’t know it. We’ll cover the answer in this series, but for now let’s just say that electrons normally end up being more smeared around space than nuclei do.

And the interactions between electrons are what causes all the complicated stuff we see.



If all we care about is the behavior of matter, we can simplify further. We can get a very long way by just finding the ground states of fixed configurations of nuclei.

Why is that enough? Well, fixed configurations work because electrons relax really quickly (CITATION NEEDED. Also, does energy get transferred to KE of protons?). And ground states are the states that systems oscillate around. So we can use those to get average bond lengths, the energy emitted by various chemical reactions, crystal structure...




The goal of this series is to get you comfortable enough with the laws of quantum mechanics that you understand


IDEA: We’re interested in the physics behind why stuff differs in the way it does. So “why do nuclei work” isn’t interesting because it doesn’t explain how stuff differs--it just is a particular way.


List chemistry and materials science and explain what they are

A really good question would be “Why are carbon and nitrogen so different?” They have almost the same number of electrons and protons--six vs seven. But their properties are astonishingly different. Carbon is black and can form graphite and diamond. Nitrogen is a gas.

Nuclei don’t really have the same kind of internal structure relevant to everyday life that molecules do. Eg if a nucleus has an extra neutron, everything is basically unaffected. And the stability is largely pretty continuous. This is totally not true for electrons.

Another example of a boring system: planets orbiting a star. They basically just orbit. Solar systems with eight planets and solar systems with nine planets are effectively indistinguishable.

This is what I love so much about chemistry--it’s the simplest system in the universe with such a staggeringly complicated set of qualitative differences.


Before quantum mechanics, humans didn’t have any idea how this complexity could come to be. We only understood relatively simple systems like star systems.



Another beautiful thing about all this is that the solution ended up being in a really different direction than I would have expected.
