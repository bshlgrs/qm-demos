In classical mechanics, we have configurations. Great explanation [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/).

We could have a probability distribution over these configurations. But the probability distribution itself isn't real. (Physics is linear in the probability distribution.)

QM is not like this. In QM, the probability distribution has a real effect. It's more like water waves. In water waves, the amount of water is conserved, and you can kind of imagine it as a probability distribution over where you'll find a randomly chosen particle. But if you try to think of it too literally that way, you'll get really confused.

Water waves by water flowing downhill. explain how that works

Quantum mechanics, similarly, is a law of physics which involves interactions between nearby parts of the probability distribution.

In QM, the wavefunction is complex and uses L2 norm.

HERE's a picture of a wavefunction. At every point, it tells you the amplitude of the particle being at that particular position.

Exercise: match wavefunction to probability distribution

We can also talk about the expectation values of things. Exercise: which wavefunction has the higher expectation value of left-ness?

--

We can have more dimensions as well. For example, we could have an x, y, and z component, so our wavefunction is a function from (x, y, z) to a complex number. The rule is the same: the probability adds up to one.


If we have multiple particles, we generalize the above in the same way that we'd generalize probability distributions in the classical configuration probability distribution case.



What do we do with this distribution? The most obvious thing is to ask how it changes over time. In classical mechanics, we mostly just want to know how things change over time. We express everything in terms of how it changes over time. For example, when you build a bridge, ideally you want all of the bricks to not be moving. You do this by effectively using the laws of how things move to figure out if the bridge bricks are going to start moving, and if they are moving, you should probably try a different way of building your bridge.

The equation that describes how this works is the Schroedinger equation. I'll explain it eventually in this series. But for most of the rest of this blog series, we're not actually going to be talking about how things move. We're almost entirely interested in the energy of electrons. TODO: MORE HERE.


ALSO ADD: QM is first order

NOTES

- link to Scott Aaronson on [why it's L2](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html)
- An interesting feature of this physics is that it's first-order.
  - TODO: find other explanations of this
- The [LessWrong QM sequence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/r6/an_intuitive_explanation_of_quantum_mechanics/)
- Another explanation of why wavefunctions are the way that they are is that they let us have a first-order system of physics.


-------------


New idea:

- QM is a way of making classical physics probablistic and first-order while keeping it local.
- talk about it for a single particle.
