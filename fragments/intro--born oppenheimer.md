The quantum mechanical behavior of electrons is quite complicated and hard to analyze. So instead of trying to model all of the quantum mechanics of electrons in the presence of nuclei, we're going to narrow our scope significantly through a series of approximations and judicious choices of what questions we want to be able to answer. This approach is known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and it has a few steps.

As I said above, the first approximation we make is modelling nuclei as classical particles which can be modelled purely in terms of their positions, masses, and charges.

Secondly, we're only consider the case where the nuclei are stationary. This approximation is valid because nuclei are so much heavier than electrons that from the perspective of the electrons they might as well be standing still. (This is known as the [Born-Oppenheimer approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer_approximation).)

Thirdly, we're not going to spend too much time figuring out how electrons behave in general, even just in the presence of a stationary collection of nuclei. We're only going to try to figure out the lowest energy configuration of the electrons.



DEMO HERE OF USING A POTENTIAL ENERGY FUNCTION FOR CLASSICAL MECHANICS

This is just a more precise version of how we analyze springs--the springs have Hooke's law because of the ground states of the electrons. We're being principled here, is the difference. TODO

So we're making a series of simplifying assumptions for the QM calculations we're going to do:

- Nuclei are fundamental.
- Nuclei are classical.
- Nuclei are still
- We only care about the lowest energy possible states of the electrons.
- Often, we don't even care about the lowest energy state, we just want to know the lowest energy.
